### LSTM price clasiffication

This project aims to clasify trends given a stock market file. We tried to use the zigzag indicator to label periods of time as uptrend or down trend.

It uses the LSTM neural network provided by TensorFlow. Also, it uses libraries like pandas_ta to compute trading indicators.

This project inits from predict.py
